## Welcome

This research explores whether Bitcoin exhibits predictable price patterns like traditional markets, and uncovers significant inefficiencies in how users pay transaction fees.

## Key Findings

- **No reliable weekly patterns** in Bitcoin price movements (efficient market)
- **Predictable overpayment patterns** in transaction fees (inefficient usage)
- **Millions of dollars wasted** by users who overpay during predictable times

## Abstract Preview

**The Big Picture:** We tested whether Bitcoin returns follow predictable weekly patterns (like stocks' famous "Monday effect"). Using 10+ years of data, we found no reliable day-of-week patterns for trading. However, we discovered something more interesting: Bitcoin users consistently overpay for transactions during predictable timesâ€”weekends and morning hoursâ€”wasting millions of dollars in unnecessary fees.
